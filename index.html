	<div><img src="file:///Users/aisleighedouard/Pictures/brownstone.png" alt=“Apartment” width="245" height="245"></div>
	 <p>Apartment searching in Athens, Georgia may yield cheaper results than in other cities, but that does not mean the process of apartment hunting is any simpler. In fact, due to the greater influx of college-aged students in the area it can be even harder to find and settle on an apartment that meets one’s standards before all availabilities are completely filled. As far as price and likely availability go, the ideal apartment style would be a four bedroom apartment with separate, fixed rents for each roommate. Under this assumption, the best deal apartments in Athens for the Fall of 2017 have been narrowed down to four main communities: The Park, River Club, and Abbey West. Closely examined, each have merits and detriments that should be presented before any application process begins.</p>
